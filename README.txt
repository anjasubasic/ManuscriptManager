How to run the program:

From the command line, do `python app.py`. This will launch the "ManuscriptManager>" prompt.
For a list of commands, type the `help` command.

Assumptions:
- We assume that the issue table is already populated in the database. (The assignment page doesn't specify any sort of command
  for "creating" and issue, only adding manuscripts to an issue.) In our provided sql code, we have populated the issue table.
- We assume that a reviewer can only resign once s/he is logged in. The assignment page seemed to imply that this command could
  be run without logging in, but we didn't think that made much sense.

Our test cases:
- Please see test_cases.txt for the cases we used to test our app.
